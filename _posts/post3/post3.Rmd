## Introduction of my Shiny App
The [**Shiny App**](https://lulu-pi.shinyapps.io/shiny-app-Lulu-Pi/) I made is used to analyse the daily cases of COVID-19 in China, including **confirmed cases, Death cases and Recovered cases** as of 30 September 2020. In order to run this app, you should install the packages below according to the session_info(). The following packages were used:

- **shiny**
- **rmarkdown**
- **readr**
- **tidyverse**
- **lubridate**
- **ggplot2**
- **plotly**
- **dplyr**

You can select any *province* that you want to check with from the select roll, and the **type of cases** on the ratio buttons, the figure would present the trend of the daily cases from the province you select since 22 January to 30 September 2020, the plotly label would show you the specific information when you click the point on the figure. 

You can obtain a table of **Confirmed cases, Deaths cases and Recovered cases** in each **province** in China on a specific *Date* that you can choose in the select-date column. There are multiple methods for you to find the results you are looking for, for example, you can simply search **Hubei** by typing in the blank column, then only the cases on that day in Hubei would appear in the table; or you can enter a number such as **5**, then all the provinces with the cases greater than five would appear in the table. 

After you choosing the specific *date* within the range, the second plotly figure would show up automatically next to the table, with those **type of cases** in three colors among all **provinces** on that day. Same as before, if you click the bar on the figure, the plotly label would show you the information with the number of cases. 

Therefore, this [**Shiny App**](https://lulu-pi.shinyapps.io/shiny-app-Lulu-Pi/) could help you analyse with the data of **daily cases** in each **province** with a clealy trend and label during the most serious period in China, and help you compare the cases of **Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered** with all **provinces** in China on a same date. By 29 January, the virus spread to all provinces of mainland China from Hubei. All provinces of mainland China initiated the highest response level to public health emergency. Hubei was the most serious province, however, the virus was controlled by the quickly responses of government and all the health workers who are on the frontlines in the battle against COVID-19, the situation was better since April.

## Self Review

<p style="border:3px solid #59788E;" <span style="color:#59788E"> 
What did I do well?
</span> </p>
I have cleaned the data and process the data in ways that could help me produce the figure more convenient. I produced 2 figures and 1 table in total, which contained vertical analysis as well as horizontal analysis, including the trend of the daily cases from a single province user selects during a time period, and also the comparison with the cases of Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered among all provinces in China on a same date. In order to help users obtain the data clearly, I added the label on both two graphs as well, the information would show up when users click the area they are cheking for. Moreover, I made the second figure link with the table, which means when the data in the table changes, the figure would change as well, they would always reflect the cases on the same day. 

<p style="border:3px solid #59788E;" <span style="color:#59788E"> 
What are the points I can improve on?
</span> </p>
When I made the app, I wanted to make the 2 figures link with each other, but I failed to produce the plotly click. If the second figure or table could change as users click on the first figure, this app would be more interactive. Moreover, the style of my shiny app could be improved with colorful text or box, in order to make the app more attractive. 

<p style="border:3px solid #59788E;" <span style="color:#59788E">
What are some things that I would like to add that's plausible?
</span> </p>
I would like to add some text box whihin the introduction and "About" part display in the app. The navbar should be added in the top of the app as well, with several parts, therefore users could simply go to the different part such as introduction part, figure part, table part and summary part. I should also add a CSS file to style my app, including the header, tags and background, making it more beautiful and attractive. In terms of the usefulness of the app, I think the data of other countries could also be contained, and the cases and trend could be compared among different countries. 

<p style="border:3px solid #59788E;" <span style="color:#59788E"> 
what are some things that I would like to add that cannot be done yet due to limitation in data or technology?
</span> </p>
I think the simple table or line chart might be a little bit boring for users, therefore I would like to add some maps of different provinces within China, but I could not find the most suitable data which can be added points or other geom on it, rather than simply showing the shape of that area.
